# Missing address validation causes issues

## Summary

There is no protection for `payer == receiver`. If  `payer == receiver`, the stream will act strangely because it is not designed to handle this case.

Another unusual case that is not protected against is when two stream clones are each others receiver. This is possible because `payer` can be any address.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `payer == receiver`, `balanceOf` [will only return `_recipientBalance` even when the payer calls it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L285-L297). This means the payer cannot get a valid answer from `balanceOf`.  When `payer == receiver`, `rescueERC20` can be called by the receiver even though the onlyPayer modifier is on this function because `payer == receiver`.

Another unusual case is when two stream clones pay each other. This is possible only [because `payer` is not necessarily msg.sender](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/StreamFactory.sol#L133-L142) and it creates an infinite loop. Because there is no on-chain storage where existing stream clones are stored (unlike Sablier, which maintains a mapping [that can be queried](https://github.com/sablierhq/sablier/blob/476bdd250a4f7ab7fcd79b9d740797da652d0690/packages/protocol/contracts/Sablier.sol#L66)), it is not possible to prevent this case with the existing contracts unless past events are checked to compile a list of existing streams.

## Impact

Unexpected stream values can result from the case of `payer == receiver` and when stream clones pay each other.

## Code Snippet

There is no code preventing `payer == receiver`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/StreamFactory.sol#L193-L200

`payer == receiver` will cause parts of the stream to act strangely. For example, `balanceOf` will only return `_recipientBalance` when the payer calls it

Compare to Sablier which has this validation
https://github.com/sablierhq/sablier/blob/476bdd250a4f7ab7fcd79b9d740797da652d0690/packages/protocol/contracts/Sablier.sol#L185

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Prevent `payer == receiver` when a new stream is created. This should be [added to the existing logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/StreamFactory.sol#L193-L200).
