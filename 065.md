# `Payer` can rug `recipient` if a special ERC20 is used

## Summary
If a special type of ERC20 is used it can result in a complete rug for `recipient`

## Vulnerability Detail
Multiple address tokens exist on the blockchain, for example Synthetix's ProxyERC20 - it exists in many forms (sUSD, SBTC..). If a `payer` deploys a `Stream` with such a token then the tokens can be stolen from the contract by the `payer`. This can happen because when calling `rescueERC20` the token address passed can be one of the other token addresses and then the `require` check in the method will be passing successfully.

## Impact
This can result in a 100% rug for the `recipient` which is a loss of value (High severity) but requires a special type of ERC20 token (low likelihood) so it should be Medium severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of checking the address of the token, check the balance of the token before and after the transfer and validate it is not changed.
