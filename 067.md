# `rescueERC20` should allow the payer to claw back overpaid amount

## Summary

The function `rescueERC20` do not allow the payer to claw back overpaid amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail

It's likely for the payments to be made in multiple installments by multiple parties, and there may be instances where the payer has overpaid for the token.

In such cases, the `rescueERC20` function should allow the payer to recover the overpaid amount by transferring the excess amount back to their own address.

However, the current implementation disallows clawing back overpaid amounts for the token itself as it checks if `tokenAddress == token` and immediately reverts with the error message `CannotRescueStreamToken` when that's the case.

## Impact

The overpaid amount can not be retrieved by the payer until the stoptime (or cancel the stream).

## Recommendation

Consider changing the `rescueERC20()` function and allowing the payer to claw back the overpaid (`tokenBalance() - remainingBalance`) amount of the token.
