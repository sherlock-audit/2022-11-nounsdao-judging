# [Gas Optimization] In Stream.sol can move The code segment L347-L351 to be before L335_L345 in the function _recipientBalance() to save gas

## Summary
In Stream.sol can move The code segment L347-L351 to be before L335_L345 in the function _recipientBalance() to save gas
## Vulnerability Detail
Gas optimization  @suggestion
For the code section in Stream.sol L347-L351
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L347-L351

```
        uint256 remainingBalance_ = remainingBalance;

        // When this function is called after the stream has been cancelled, when balance is less than
        // tokenAmount, without this early exit, the withdrawal calculation below results in an underflow error.
        if (remainingBalance_ == 0) return 0;
```

In case remainingBalance_ is 0, then all the calculation from Line 335 to 345 is useless because the function still return 0.

```
	uint256 balance;
        if (blockTime >= stopTime()) {
            balance = tokenAmount_;
        } else {
            // This is safe because: blockTime > startTime_ (checked above).
            unchecked {
                uint256 elapsedTime_ = blockTime - startTime_;
                balance = (elapsedTime_ * ratePerSecond()) / RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER; 
            }
        }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the implementation to. Rerun all the tests -> Results passed 
```
	uint256 startTime_ = startTime();
        uint256 blockTime = block.timestamp;

        if (blockTime <= startTime_) return 0;
		
	uint256 remainingBalance_ = remainingBalance;

        // When this function is called after the stream has been cancelled, when balance is less than
        // tokenAmount, without this early exit, the withdrawal calculation below results in an underflow error.
        if (remainingBalance_ == 0) return 0; 

	uint256 tokenAmount_ = tokenAmount();
        
       uint256 balance;
        if (blockTime >= stopTime()) {
            balance = tokenAmount_;
        } else {
            // This is safe because: blockTime > startTime_ (checked above).
            unchecked {
                uint256 elapsedTime_ = blockTime - startTime_;
                balance = (elapsedTime_ * ratePerSecond()) / RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER; 
            }
        }
```
