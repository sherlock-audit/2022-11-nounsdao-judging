# Anyone can fabricate the stream history

## Summary

Anyone can create dummy streams, even invalid ones for past.

## Vulnerability Detail

While the function `createStream()` is callable by anyone, it does not check if `startTime` is greater than `block.timestamp`.
So it is possible for anyone to fabricate the stream history with arbitrary stream data (payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime).

Furthermore, there is no way to check if a stream was actually valid one (except the off-chain method to check the withdrawal events but it is not reliable again because a recipient might have not called withdraw yet).
If this kind of check is required by any means in the future, it will be difficult to work out.

```solidity
function createStream(
    address payer,
    address recipient,
    uint256 tokenAmount,
    address tokenAddress,
    uint256 startTime,
    uint256 stopTime,
    uint8 nonce
) public returns (address stream) {
    // These input checks are here rather than in Stream because these parameters are written
    // using clone-with-immutable-args, meaning they are already set when Stream is created and can't be
    // verified there. The main benefit of this approach is significant gas savings.
    if (payer == address(0)) revert PayerIsAddressZero();
    if (recipient == address(0)) revert RecipientIsAddressZero();
    if (tokenAmount == 0) revert TokenAmountIsZero();
    if (stopTime <= startTime) revert DurationMustBePositive();
    if (tokenAmount < stopTime - startTime) revert TokenAmountLessThanDuration();

    stream = streamImplementation.cloneDeterministic(
        encodeData(payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime),
        salt(
            msg.sender, payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, nonce
        )
    );
    IStream(stream).initialize();

    emit StreamCreated(
        msg.sender, payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, stream
        );
}

```

## Impact

Anyone can fabricate the stream history and it might affect future usage/tracking.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Consider limiting access to creating streams.
2. Consider adding a check `startTime >= block.timestamp` before creating a stream.
3. Consider adding a flag in the stream to show if actual tokens were deposited/streamed.
