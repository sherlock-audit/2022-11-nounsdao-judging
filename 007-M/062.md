# Missing input validation can result in `Stream` `recipient` instantly receiving all tokens

## Summary
It is possible that a `payer` configures `Stream` improperly, resulting in `recipient` instantly receiving all tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
`StreamFactory::createStream` does input validation for the deployment of a new `Stream`. The problem is that the validation is incomplete - both `startTime` and `stopTime` can be before the current `block.timestamp`. This can happen if a `payer` that is deploying a new `Stream` fat-fingers the values of `startTime` and `stopTime` or if they are just improperly calculated. This will result in inability to cancel the `Stream` without the `recipient` getting all of the tokens, and he can just claim them any time.

## Impact
This can result in an unexpected malfunction of value transfer in the protocol from the `payer` viewpoint. Missing important input validations are Medium severity.

## Recommendation
Adding a validation that `startTime >= block.timestamp` will resolve the issue
