# `RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER * tokenAmount() / duration` in unchecked block of `ratePerSecond()` can overflow

## Summary
The ratePerSecond computation `RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER * tokenAmount() / duration` in `ratePerSecond()`  can overflow. Since this computation is in a unchecked block and thus won't be reverted, wrong `balance` of recipient would be returned to `_recipientBalance()` and `withdraw()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
1.  The related codes are shown as follow. `RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER = 1e6`, `tokenAmount()` can return a value as maximum as `2^256-1`, and let `duration = 1e5`, then the computation result of `RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER * tokenAmount() / duration` would be larger than `2^256-1`, and `ratePerSecond()` returns an overflowed uint256 value.
```solidity
    uint256 public constant RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER = 1e6;

    function tokenAmount() public pure returns (uint256) {
        return _getArgUint256(60);
    }

    function ratePerSecond() public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 duration = stopTime() - startTime();
        unchecked {
            return RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER * tokenAmount() / duration;
        }
    }
```

2.  Let `balance'` denote the overflowed balance, and `balance` represent the correct balance. We can have the following two cases:
- case `balance < amount < balance'`, the recipient can withdraw tokens at a faster rate, or in extreme case, only one-time withdraw is needed.
- case `balance' < amount < balance`, the recipient would receive a smaller amount of tokens each time unless stop time reached.
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external onlyPayerOrRecipient {
        if (amount == 0) revert CantWithdrawZero();
        address recipient_ = recipient();

        uint256 balance = balanceOf(recipient_);
        if (balance < amount) revert AmountExceedsBalance();

        // This is safe because it should always be the case that:
        // remainingBalance >= balance >= amount.
        unchecked {
            remainingBalance = remainingBalance - amount;
        }

        token().safeTransfer(recipient_, amount);
        emit TokensWithdrawn(msg.sender, recipient_, amount);
    }
```

## Impact
The recipient would receive unexpected smaller or larger amount of tokens for each `withdraw()`.

## Recommendation
Change from
```solidity
    function ratePerSecond() public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 duration = stopTime() - startTime();
        unchecked {
            return RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER * tokenAmount() / duration;
        }
    }
```
to
```solidity
    function ratePerSecond() public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 duration = stopTime() - startTime();
        return RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER * tokenAmount() / duration;
    }
```
