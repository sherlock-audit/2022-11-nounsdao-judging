# Not possible to update stream params, need to deploy new stream in case when bigger amount is needed

## Summary
Not possible to update stream params, need to deploy new stream in case when bigger amount is needed
## Vulnerability Detail
When Stream is created token amount is set and you can't change it later.
But it's possible that token amount should be increased.
Currently you need to create new Stream, because there is no ability to change Stream.tokenAmount() value.

However it's cheaper just to provide setter and use same contract instead of deploying of new one.

Scenario.
1.Stream has created to pay 1000$ during 1 month.
2.There is a need to increase payment to 1500$.
3.Currently you need to create new Stream for 500$.
## Impact
Not possible to increase stream tokens amount. Need to deploy new Stream which is more expensive.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add setter function that can be called by payer only and will check that newTokenAmount provided is bigger then Stream's current tokenAmount() and will increase remainingBalance by newTokenAmount - tokenAmount().
