# Recipient is not entitled to any funds if the fund amount is too small

## Summary

Depending on the chosen duration and the amount of tokens, the recipient might not be eligible to withdraw funds from the stream.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ratePerSecond()` function calculates the at which rate the recipient is allows to withdraw funds. The calculation is performed as follows:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L136](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L136)

`RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER` is defined as `1e6`. Therefore, if `duration` is larger as `tokenAmount()` * `1e6`, the rate will be zero, and the recipient will not be able to withdraw the funds during the stream period. 

For example when depositing 1 wei for a duration of >1e6 seconds (11,6 days), 2 wei for a duration of >23,1 days. For a duration of >100 year, a deposit of 3153 wei would result in a rate of 0.

## Impact

The impact is minimal as this is only applicable to very small deposit amounts and large stream durations. On top of that, after the stream period ends, the recipient is eligible to withdraw the funds anyway because of the following check:

## Recommendation

We recommend to check whether the calculation of the rate per second will not result in zero. This should actually be implemented in the `createStream()` function of the StreamFactory contract before performing the clone and actually deploying the contract:
