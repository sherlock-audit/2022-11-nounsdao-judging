# StreamFactory can be unable to createStreams neither initialize them

## Summary
If wrongly assigned `streamImplementation` to `address(0)`, `StreamFactory.sol` won't be able to create or initialize `Stream`s 

## Vulnerability Detail
If `streamImplementation` is set to `0x0` in the `StreamFactory.sol` contract, the `createStream()` function will revert when it is called. This is because the function would call a non existing function in target address and therefore will revert. 

Additionally, if streamImplementation is set to `0x0`, the `StreamFactory.sol` contract will not be able to initialize Stream contracts, as it will not be able to call the Stream contract's `initialize()` function that is called inside `createStream`.

## Impact
`Factory` not able to `createStreams` neither initialize them. Force of redeploy / gas wasted on deployments.

## Recommendation
Add a check for not assigning `address(0)` to `streamImplementation` in constructor
