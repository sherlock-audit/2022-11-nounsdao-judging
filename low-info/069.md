# Stream contract formal verification with certora

## Summary
Formal verification of Stream contract with certora

## Vulnerability Detail
N/A

## Impact
Formal verification can significantly increase security of the protocol. Execution of all rules can done with certora:
```bash
bash certora/scripts/verifyStream.sh          
```

## Code Snippet
Certora specification for Stream contract: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/certora/specs/Stream.spec#L1-L221

#### 1.SanityCheck &check;
```text
rule sanityCheck() {
    ...
}
```

#### 2. Recipient balance should never exceed remaining balance &check;
```text
{ remainingBalance >= recipientBalance }
op;
{ remainingBalance >= recipientBalance }
```

#### 3. Solvency - Token balance should be bigger or equal to remainingBalance &check;
```text
{ remainingBalance <= token.balanceOf(contract) }
op;
{ remainingBalance <= token.balanceOf(contract) }
```

#### 4. Recipient balance is correctly vested over time &check;
```text
getRecipientBalance() => elapsed * tokenAmount() / duration;
```

#### 5. Integrity of withdraw &check;
```text
{ recipientBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(recipient())
  contractBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(currentContract)
  remainingBalanceBefore = remainingBalance }
withdraw(amount)
{ recipientBalanceBefore == USDC.balanceOf(recipient() + amount)
  contractBalanceBefore  USDC.balanceOf(currentContract) - amount
  remainingBalanceBefore = remainingBalance - amount}
```

#### 6. Withdraw all remainingBalance when stopTime passed &check;
```text
{ timestamp > stopTime && remainingBalanceBefore = remainingBalance }
withdraw(remainingBalance)
{ remainingBalance = 0 }
```

#### 7. Integrity of cancel &check;
```text
cancel()
{ remainingBalance == 0 && token.balanceOf(contract) == 0 }
```

#### 8. Integrity of rescueERC20 &check;
```text
{ remainingBalanceBefore = remainingBalance && balanceBefore = token.balanceOf(contract) }
rescueERC20()
{ remainingBalanceBefore == remainingBalance && balanceBefore == token.balanceOf(contract) }
```

#### 9. Integrity of ratePerSecond &check;
```text
ratePerSecond()
{ !REVERTS }
```

#### 10. Integrity of balanceOf &check;
```text
balanceOf()
{ !REVERTS }
```

#### 11. Withdraw should revert after cancel was called &check;
```text
cancel(e)
{ withdraw(e) => REVERTED }
```

## Tool used
Certora

## Recommendation
It is recommended to use formal verification of the protocol.
