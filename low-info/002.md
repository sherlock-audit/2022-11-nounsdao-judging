# rescueERC20() restriction problem

## Summary
#rescueERC20() Recover ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to this stream. but can't recover stream's payment token
so  if stream's payment token accidentally sent more then tokenAmount()  , only get token back  by  call #cacel() and need wait time out. 
It is suggested that you can get the extra amount back.

## Vulnerability Detail
can't recover stream's payment token 
```solidity
    function rescueERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyPayer {
        if (tokenAddress == address(token())) revert CannotRescueStreamToken();

        IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

## Impact
if pay more, get token back  by  call #cacel() and need wait time out.

## Recommendation
can get the extra amount back.
```solidity
    function rescueERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyPayer {
-       if (tokenAddress == address(token())) revert CannotRescueStreamToken();

+       if (tokenAddress == address(token()) && tokenBalance() - amount < remainingBalance) revert CannotRescueStreamToken();

        IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
