# StreamFactory.sol: Fee-on-transfer tokens not supported in "createAndFundStream" function

## Summary
The `StreamFactory.createAndFundStream` function allows to create a stream with a `tokenAmount` and fund it with this `tokenAmount`.
This does not work correctly for fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
For a fee-on-transfer tokens, the amount received by the stream contract is not equal to the `tokenAmount`.
The `Stream` should be created with a token amount that is equal to the amount that is received by the stream after the transfer.

## Impact
The tokens sent to the `Stream` will not be sufficient to pay the recipient.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the predicted stream address.
Calculate the difference in the balance of the stream address before and after the token transfer.
Create the stream with this calculated token amount.
