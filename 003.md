# Recipient can lose funds

## Summary
Payer can create a new stream using `createStream` function and not pay any amount with it. Since Payer can pass any arbitrary tokenAmount and tokenAddress so the newly created stream will show the custom tokenAmount which it does not actually have. Recipient who is checking the tokenAmount would feel safe and continue streaming but in end when try to withdraw, it would fail due to insufficient funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Payer A creates a new stream using `createStream` function

```solidity
function createStream(
        address payer,
        address recipient,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address tokenAddress,
        uint256 startTime,
        uint256 stopTime
    ) public returns (address) {
        return createStream(payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, 0);
    }
```

3. A new Stream S1 is created with tokenAmount T1. Note payer has not added any funds (this function does not enforce user to pay)
4. Recipient after streaming some time checks his balance using `balance` function and see that balance amount is non zero. So he is convinced and thinks to withdraw at stream end

```solidity
function balanceOf(address who) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 recipientBalance = _recipientBalance();

        if (who == recipient()) return recipientBalance;
       ...
    }
```

```solidity
 function _recipientBalance() internal view returns (uint256) {
        ...

        uint256 tokenAmount_ = tokenAmount();
        uint256 balance;
        if (blockTime >= stopTime()) {
            balance = tokenAmount_;
        } else {
            // This is safe because: blockTime > startTime_ (checked above).
            unchecked {
                uint256 elapsedTime_ = blockTime - startTime_;
                balance = (elapsedTime_ * ratePerSecond()) / RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER;
            }
        }
...
}
```

6. At stream end, recipient try to withdraw the amount but it fails since contract does not hold any funds

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external onlyPayerOrRecipient {
        if (amount == 0) revert CantWithdrawZero();
        address recipient_ = recipient();

        uint256 balance = balanceOf(recipient_);
        ...

        token().safeTransfer(recipient_, amount);
        emit TokensWithdrawn(msg.sender, recipient_, amount);
    }
```

## Impact

## Recommendation
Create stream should always take funds from payer
