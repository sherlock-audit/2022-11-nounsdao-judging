# Payer is not enforced to pay the recipient

## Summary

The payer is not enforced to pay the recipient

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, StreamFactory.sol#createStream can be used to create a stream with a payer

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Create a new stream contract instance.
     * @param payer the account responsible for funding the stream.
     * @param recipient the recipient of the stream.
     * @param tokenAmount the total token amount payer is streaming to recipient.
     * @param tokenAddress the contract address of the payment token.
     * @param startTime the unix timestamp for when the stream starts.
     * @param stopTime the unix timestamp for when the stream ends.
     * @return stream the address of the new stream contract.
     */
    function createStream(
        address payer,
        address recipient,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address tokenAddress,
        uint256 startTime,
        uint256 stopTime
    ) external returns (address) {
        return createStream(payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, 0);
    }
```

the expected behavior is:

first create the stream, then fund it later when funds are available.

However, the payer is not enforced to pay the recipient, the payer could be set as a EOA account and can call

Stream.sol#cancel to withdraw the fund and set remainingBalance to 0 to not paying the recipient any time.

```solidity
function cancel() external onlyPayerOrRecipient {
    address payer_ = payer();
    address recipient_ = recipient();
    IERC20 token_ = token();

    uint256 recipientBalance = balanceOf(recipient_);

    // This zeroing is important because without it, it's possible for recipient to obtain additional funds
    // from this contract if anyone (e.g. payer) sends it tokens after cancellation.
    // Thanks to this state update, `balanceOf(recipient_)` will only return zero in future calls.
    remainingBalance = 0;

    if (recipientBalance > 0) token_.safeTransfer(recipient_, recipientBalance);

    // Using the stream's token balance rather than any other calculated field because it gracefully
    // supports cancelling the stream even if payer hasn't fully funded it.
    uint256 payerBalance = tokenBalance();
    if (payerBalance > 0) {
        token_.safeTransfer(payer_, payerBalance);
    }

    emit StreamCancelled(msg.sender, payer_, recipient_, payerBalance, recipientBalance);
}
```

## Impact

This design allows the payer to game the streaming payment and rug the recipient but breaking the term and not pay the recipient.

## Recommendation

We recommend the project make sure when the stream is created, the payer send some token to Stream.sol contract to make sure at least the payer has some commitment to the recipient.
