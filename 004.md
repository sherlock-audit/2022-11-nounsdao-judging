# Expired streams can be added

## Summary
There is no check to verify if created stream is already expired. In such cases the recipient can immediately grab all funds without providing any stream

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume current `block.timestamp` is X
2. Payer adds a new stream with startTime as X-100 and stopTime as X
3. This will get passed as only check is

```solidity
if (stopTime <= startTime) revert DurationMustBePositive();
```

4. Once this stream is created, recipient can immediately take advantage of this human error and grab all funds as stopTime is already reached

## Impact
Payer will lose funds

## Recommendation
Add below checks

```solidity
 if (block.timestamp <= startTime) revert DurationMustBePositive();
```
