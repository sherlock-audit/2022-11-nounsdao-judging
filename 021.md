# Payer in Stream.sol is not capable of calling the Stream#cancel, Stream#withdraw and Stream#resuceERC20

## Summary

Payer in Stream.sol is not capable of calling the Stream#cancel, Stream#withdraw and Stream#resuceERC20

## Vulnerability Detail

I want to quote from the doc:

#### Creating a DAO proposal with Streamer

> First the user (in our case the DAO's web UI) calls predictStreamAddress to get the future stream contract address.
Then a proposal can be composed with the following two transactions:

> StreamFactory.createStream(...), where the new stream's address should match predictStreamAddress
Payer.sendOrRegisterDebt(...), where the payment recipient is the address from predictStreamAddress
Once executed, the Token Buyer and Payer contracts work together to fund the new stream asynchronously, and once funded the stream's recipient can withdraw their streamed funds.

the assumption is that the payer address is

https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/blob/main/src/Payer.sol

In Stream.sol, Stream#cancel, Stream#withdraw is restricted by the modifier  onlyPayerOrRecipient

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Reverts if the caller is not the payer or the recipient of the stream.
     */
    modifier onlyPayerOrRecipient() {
        if (msg.sender != recipient() && msg.sender != payer()) {
            revert CallerNotPayerOrRecipient();
        }

        _;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Reverts if the caller is not the payer of the stream.
     */
    modifier onlyPayer() {
        if (msg.sender != payer()) {
            revert CallerNotPayer();
        }

        _;
    }
```

and Stream#resuceERC20 is restricted by the modifier onlyPayer

## Impact

the payer is expected to call Stream#cancel to cancel payment stream and call Stream#withdraw to send the eligible vested token amount to recipient.

the payer is expected to call rescueERC20 to rescue ERC20 token that is mistakenly sent into the contract.

However, if the payer is capable of calling Payer.sendOrRegisterDebt(...), the payer is not capable of calling the function below.

## Recommendation

We recommend the project make sure the payer is capable of calling Stream#cancel, Stream#withdraw and Stream#resuceERC20.
