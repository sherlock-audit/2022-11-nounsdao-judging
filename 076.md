# `payer` cannot cancel if the `recipient` is blacklisted by `USDC`

## Summary
The `cancel()` function will revert if the `recipient` is blacklisted by `USDC`

## Vulnerability Detail
One of the key functionalities of the `Stream` contract is the ability for either party to choose to cancel.
In such case, the stream should distribute each party's fair share of tokens.
The issue is that if the `recipient` is blacklisted by `USDC`, the call will always revert [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L249). 

## Impact
The `payer` will not be able to retrieve their share of the funds. The funds are also stuck permanently in the `Stream` contract, as the rescue function [does not work for the stream token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L269).
It is worth noting addresses can get [blacklisted by Circle at any time](https://cryptoslate.com/circle-blacklists-all-tornado-cash-eth-addresses-effectively-freezing-usdc/).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a try/catch block for the USDC transfers in cancel(), so that it the `recipient` is blacklisted, it is caught and the call goes through.

```solidity
        try token_.safeTransfer(recipient_, recipientBalance) {
        } catch {
        }
```
This way the `payer` would retrieve the entire balance, and no funds will be stuck in the contract.
