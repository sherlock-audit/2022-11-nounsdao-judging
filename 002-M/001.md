# cancel() maybe can't execute

## Summary

if token==usdc and recipient are in the blocklist of usdc, #cancel() will revert, resulting in the inability to get the remaining funds back.

## Vulnerability Detail

#Cancel() is used when the payer find that the recipient has no right to get the remaining funds, then the payer will call #cancel() to get funds back so that the recipient can't get the subsequent funds (which will increase over time).

But in one case, suppose token==usdc,
If the recipient enters the blacklist of usdc for some reason, it will lead to #cancel() revert because usdc.transfer(recipient) will revert,
As a result, the payer cannot get the funds back by #cancel(), and no other way to get funds back(#rescueERC20() also can't ) and the funds will always be locked in the contract.

```solidity
    function cancel() external onlyPayerOrRecipient {
...
        remainingBalance = 0;
        //**@audit if recipient_ in blacklist of usdc , transfer will revert***//
        if (recipientBalance > 0) token_.safeTransfer(recipient_, recipientBalance);

...
    }
```

usdc contract:
```solidity
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value)
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        notBlacklisted(msg.sender)
        notBlacklisted(to) //*** @audit if in blacklist will revert***//
        returns (bool)
    {
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
        return true;
    }
```

## Impact

payer can't get funds back by #cancel()

## Recommendation

use try to Ignore revert
```solidity
    function cancel() external onlyPayerOrRecipient {
...
        remainingBalance = 0;
-       if (recipientBalance > 0) token_.safeTransfer(recipient_, recipientBalance);
+       if (recipientBalance > 0) {
+            if (tokenBalance() < recipientBalance){
+                revert AmountExceedsBalance();
+            }
+            try token().transfer(recipient_, recipientBalance) {                
+            }catch{} // In rare cases, failure occurs. Even if it really fails, payer keep it 
+        }
...

```
