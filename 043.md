# Max duration and end time

## Summary
Stream factory does not have enough validations for time settings to prevent accidental lock of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a stream, the user can choose any ```startTime``` and ```stopTime``` as long as these conditions are met:
```solidity
     if (stopTime <= startTime) revert DurationMustBePositive();
     if (tokenAmount < stopTime - startTime) revert TokenAmountLessThanDuration();
```
It does not validate that the duration is not absurdly long, e.g. 100 years, or that the end timestamp is not too far in the future, e.g. year 2100. I believe the protocol should be robust enough to save users from such mistakes. For example, a maximum duration could be 4 years, and the max end time could be now +5 years or something like that.

## Impact
If a stream is created with an impractical duration or stop time, and then funded with some tokens, these tokens will be inaccessible unless the stream is canceled by the payer.

## Recommendation
Consider introducing reasonable maximum duration and stop-time limits.
