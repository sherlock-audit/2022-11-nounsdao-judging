# Missing event emitting for function `Stream.rescueERC20`

## Summary
Contract `Stream` emits events for functions such as `withdraw` and `cancel`. The issue is that function `rescueERC20` is missing such an event emitting.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `rescueERC20` of `Stream` contract is missing emitting of event such as `event RescueERC20(token, amount)`.

## Impact
Off-chain applications that monitor protocol will be not able to monitor withdrawal of arbitrary ERC20 tokens "rescuing" that have been transferred to the contract.
