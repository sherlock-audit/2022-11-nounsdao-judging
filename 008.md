# Payment Token accidentally sent to the contract would be temporarily locked

## Summary
The `rescueERC20 ()` function is used to recover accidental tokens sent to the stream. From its implementation, the contract does not permit retrieval of payment tokens. As a result, accidental transfer of the payment tokens to the contract cannot be retrieved using this function. Interestingly the contract has an unused function `tokenAndOutstandingBalance ()` which tracks the stream's token balance vs the token amount required to meet the commitment as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L316-L320. 
As a result, it is possible to distinguish which part of the stream's payment token is part of the stream and which part is not hence can be retrieved. 
The only option for retrieval of stream payment tokens which have been accidentally sent is to call the `cancel ()` function which will transfer the remainder to the `payer` address. As such, the accidental sent tokens would be stuck in the contract for at least until the stream ends. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `rescueERC20 ()` function does not permit retrieval of stream's payment tokens as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L268-L273. As a result, accidental transfer of this tokens would be stuck in the contract atleast until the `cancel ()` function is called which will send the token balance as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L255.
## Impact
Accidental transfer of stream's payment token would be stuck until the `cancel ()` function is  called to retrieve it. With this, it makes sense to only call the `cancel ()` function when the stream has ended

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The project can consider using the `tokenAndOutstandingBalance ()` function as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L316-L318 to allow recovery of excess payment tokens in the contract
