# Stream never receives tokens from payer

## Summary

Nouns Streamer is based on Sablier, with some changes. One change that is made is that no `transferFrom` happens to transfer tokens from the payer to the stream contract. This missing step breaks the entire stream process. The only way that the receiver can receive their tokens is if the payer manually transfers their tokens to the stream contract. This causes the stream to be useless unless the payer performs a manual step to make the stream work.

## Vulnerability Detail

Sablier [takes a deposit from the payer](https://github.com/sablierhq/sablier/blob/476bdd250a4f7ab7fcd79b9d740797da652d0690/packages/protocol/contracts/Sablier.sol#L223) at the time that a stream is started. This ensures that the stream contract hold a non-zero sum of tokens so that `withdrawFromStream` can be called by the receiver to withdraw tokens. [A key line is checking `balance >= amount`](https://github.com/sablierhq/sablier/blob/476bdd250a4f7ab7fcd79b9d740797da652d0690/packages/protocol/contracts/Sablier.sol#L248). Nouns streamer [has this same check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L218) to make sure the contract balance is greater than the withdraw amount. The problem in Nouns streamer is that no tokens are transferred from the payer to the stream clone [when the stream is created](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/StreamFactory.sol#L202-L212). This is a problem because `initialize` sets `remainingBalance` to `tokenBalance` at initialization, but at initialization the stream clone contains no tokens. This means the stream clone holds no tokens and the receiver will not be able to receiver any value unless the sender chooses to manually send the proper number of tokens to the stream clone address, because Nouns streamer does not handle this process automatically.

## Impact

Stream process is broken because stream clone contract never receives tokens from sender. When the receiver tries to withdraw from the stream, it will revert unless the sender takes extra manual steps.

## Code Snippet

The key missing line is a `safeTransferFrom` to send tokens from the payer to the stream clone contract when the stream is created
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/StreamFactory.sol#L202-L212

Sablier does have this line with `safeTransferFrom` to take tokens from the sender

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `safeTransferFrom` to take `tokenAmount` tokens from the sender on stream creation
