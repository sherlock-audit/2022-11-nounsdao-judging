# After cancellation, there is no way for payer to recover streaming tokens sent by mistake

## Summary
No way to recover to recover ``tokenAddress`` tokens sent by mistake

## Vulnerability Detail
In cancel(), nounsDao has following logic.
```solidity
        // This zeroing is important because without it, it's possible for recipient to obtain additional funds
        // from this contract if anyone (e.g. payer) sends it tokens after cancellation.
        // Thanks to this state update, `balanceOf(recipient_)` will only return zero in future calls.
        remainingBalance = 0; 

        if (recipientBalance > 0) token_.safeTransfer(recipient_, recipientBalance);
 ```
 Basically its to block recipients from withdrawing if payer sends token amount after cancellation.
 However in current state there is no way for payer to retrieve this way as well.
 
## Impact
Tokens sent my mistake would remain inside contract forever.
