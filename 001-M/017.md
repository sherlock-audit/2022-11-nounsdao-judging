# Stream.rescueERC20 allows to transfer token() in case of 2 address tokens

## Summary
Stream.rescueERC20 allows to transfer token() in case of 2 address tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
While communicating with developers they said that they currently will use USDC and WETH, but `we want to support any popular ERC20, but have not planned to support tokens with behavior like rebasing or fee on transfer`. I would like to describe another type of tokens that will not work correctly with protocol.

Stream.rescueERC20 allows payer to rescue tokens that are sent by mistake.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L268-L272
``` solidity
    function rescueERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyPayer {
        if (tokenAddress == address(token())) revert CannotRescueStreamToken();


        IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
As you can see it's not possible to withdraw payment token.
However if payment token is 2 address token(multiple address token) than payer can bypass that restriction, using another token address.
## Impact
Payer can withdraw all payment tokens after vesting period has finished.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not use 2 address tokens.
