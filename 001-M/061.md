# rescueERC20() is not safe for tokens with multiple addresses

## Summary

The function `rescueERC20()` did not follow the best practice and it does not protect the streaming token from being swept by the payer.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens have multiple addresses and a comparison of the token address is not enough to protect the streaming token from being rescued. (Explained [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#multiple-token-addresses)).

```solidity
function rescueERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyPayer {
    if (tokenAddress == address(token())) revert CannotRescueStreamToken(); //@audit not enough protection

    IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

## Impact

The payer can sweep the token that is required for commitment to recipient.

## Recommendation

Check the before/after balances of the protocol for the streaming token instead of comparing the token address.
