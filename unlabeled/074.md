# `Recipient` is not guaranteed to receive all the `tokenAmount()`

## Summary
The **Recipient** is not guaranteed to receive all the `tokenAmount()`

## Vulnerability Detail
If `cancel()` invoked by **PAYER** before the `stopTime()` reaches out, the **Recipient** will lose the remaining amount
because this line 
```Solidity
remainingBalance = 0;
```

## Impact
- The **PAYER** can cancel the stream at any time (and the **Recipient** will lose the rest)
- The **PAYER**  can invoke `cancel()` in case `blockTime < startTime()` 

## Code Snippet
```Solidity
    function cancel() external onlyPayerOrRecipient {
        address payer_ = payer();
        address recipient_ = recipient();
        IERC20 token_ = token();

        uint256 recipientBalance = balanceOf(recipient_);

        // This zeroing is important because without it, it's possible for recipient to obtain additional funds
        // from this contract if anyone (e.g. payer) sends it tokens after cancellation.
        // Thanks to this state update, `balanceOf(recipient_)` will only return zero in future calls.
        remainingBalance = 0;

        if (recipientBalance > 0) token_.safeTransfer(recipient_, recipientBalance);

        // Using the stream's token balance rather than any other calculated field because it gracefully
        // supports cancelling the stream even if payer hasn't fully funded it.
        uint256 payerBalance = tokenBalance();
        if (payerBalance > 0) {
            token_.safeTransfer(payer_, payerBalance);
        }

        emit StreamCancelled(msg.sender, payer_, recipient_, payerBalance, recipientBalance);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The **PAYER** should not be able to cancel the stream 
may be just stopping it for some time
