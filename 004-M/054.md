# token can get stuck inside ``Stream`` contract

## Summary
``rescueERC20`` function is used to rescue stucked tokens inside the ``Stream`` contract. It works for all tokens except for the token used for the stream payment.

When the stream has ended by reaching its stop time or by being `cancel`ed the surplus payment token sent after this "end" event gets stuck inside the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine the flowing two scenarios:

a) In the same block the stream gets canceled first then someone else (in the same block but a transaction after the cancellation) sends the payment token to the contract

or 

b) The stream has already ended and someone else later sends the payment token to the contract.

In both scenarios **if the sent token was not the payment one the payer user can save it by calling** ``rescueERC20``

## Impact
Not all tokens can be saved from being stuck in the contract even if the stream has ended its founding and the recepient and payer got their fair share of tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow recovering the payment token after the stream has ended its founding like this:

```diff
    function rescueERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyPayer {
-      if (tokenAddress == address(token())) revert CannotRescueStreamToken();
+      if (tokenAddress == address(token()) && remainingBalance != 0) revert CannotRescueStreamToken();

        IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
