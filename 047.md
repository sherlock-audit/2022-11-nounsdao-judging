# The ````Stream```` contract is designed to receive ETH but not implement function for withdrawal

## Summary
The ````Stream```` contract instances can receive ETH but can not withdraw, ETH occasionally sent by users will be stuck in those contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Shown as the test case, it can receive ETH normally.
```solidity
contract StreamReceiveETHTest is StreamTest {
    function setUp() public override {
        super.setUp();
    }

    function test_receiveETH() public {
        s = Stream(
            factory.createStream(
                payer, recipient, STREAM_AMOUNT, address(token), startTime, stopTime
            )
        );

        vm.deal(payer, 10 ether);
        vm.prank(payer);
        (bool success, ) = address(s).call{value: 1 ether}("");
        assertEq(success, true);
        assertEq(address(s).balance, 1 ether);
    }
}
```

Result
```solidity

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a ````rescueETH()```` function which is similar with the existing ````rescueERC20()````
