# A stream can be initialized more than once

## Summary
The `Stream` contract has a custom `initialize ()` function which can only be called by the factory. From the code comments,  `This does create the possibility for the factory to initialize the same stream twice; this risk seems low
     * and worth the gas savings.` as a gas savings initiative the project chose not not to restrict possible repetitive `initialize` invocations as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L195-L200
     * However, the impact is quite significant considering it will alter the `remainingBalance` which will severely affect the contract. As such, in as much as it is true the likelihood of this happening is little, the impact would be dire hence it would be appropriate to invoke the restriction. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `initialize ()` function as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L195-L199 allows for the possibility of it being invoked more than once by the `factory`. Although this call is only restricted to the factory which significantly reduces the likelihood but the impact is quite significant as it affects the `remainingBalance`
## Impact
The `remainingBalance` is significant to the accounting of the contract as it tracks the token balance while factoring in withdrawals. Any later changes to this variable affects the entire accounting of the contract.

## Recommendation
Consider restricting the `initialize ()` function to prevent repetitive invocation.
