# IStream.sol: Missing function to calculate amount to withdraw

## Summary
The interface definition of the `Stream` only contains the `initialize` and `withdraw` functions.
This is not enough to use the `Stream` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `IStream` contract should at least include the `balanceOf` function as well.
It is needed for the `recipient` to determine the `amount` parameter to call `withdraw` with.

## Impact
Without determining the `amount` parameter the `withdraw` function can be called with an amount that is too big (function call reverts) or too small (recipient is missing out on funds).

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `balanceOf` function to the `IStream` interface.
