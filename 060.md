# Protocol can become useless by malicious attackers through front-running

## Summary

A malicious attacker can front-run `createStream()` and deploy the same stream implementation before the protocol and this prevents the stream's initialization, which makes the protocol useless.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `createStream()` function at StreamFactory.sol #L184 clones the stream implementation with data and salt based on the input arguments.
The problem is the stream initialization is called after calling `cloneDeterministic()`.

```solidity
function createStream(
    address payer,
    address recipient,
    uint256 tokenAmount,
    address tokenAddress,
    uint256 startTime,
    uint256 stopTime,
    uint8 nonce
) public returns (address stream) {
    // These input checks are here rather than in Stream because these parameters are written
    // using clone-with-immutable-args, meaning they are already set when Stream is created and can't be
    // verified there. The main benefit of this approach is significant gas savings.
    if (payer == address(0)) revert PayerIsAddressZero();
    if (recipient == address(0)) revert RecipientIsAddressZero();
    if (tokenAmount == 0) revert TokenAmountIsZero();
    if (stopTime <= startTime) revert DurationMustBePositive();
    if (tokenAmount < stopTime - startTime) revert TokenAmountLessThanDuration();

    stream = streamImplementation.cloneDeterministic(
        encodeData(payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime),
        salt(
            msg.sender, payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, nonce
        )
    );
    IStream(stream).initialize();

    emit StreamCreated(
        msg.sender, payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, stream
        );
}
```

Because `create2()` reverts if it is called with the same arguments, an attacker can front-run and deploys the exact same implementation before the protocol to make the call to `cloneDeterministic()` revert.
As a result, stream initialization will not be called and `remainingBalance()` will stay zero.
This affects the whole streaming logic and the protocol becomes useless.
Furthermore, the streams are likely to be created based on DAO proposals which will go through some time period.
So this attack can make the whole effort useless and selectively prevent creating an unfavorable stream.

## Impact

The protocol becomes useless because its core functionalities will not work.
Although I could not find any lock of funds from this exploit (because funds can be claimed via `cancel()` anyway), I set the impact level to High because it makes the whole protocol useless.

## Recommendation

It is not desirable doing initialization things out of contract from the factory level.
I recommend adding an `initialized` flag in the stream contract and to check that before any user interactions.
Of course, it should be ensured that initialization is done at most once.
