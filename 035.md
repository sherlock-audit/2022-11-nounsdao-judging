# Lack of validation of `startTime` and `stopTime` when creating new Stream

## Summary

It is possible to create and/or fund a stream with start and end times in the past.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no verification to `startTime` and `endTime` when creating a new stream

## Impact

The lack of validation breaks this main functionality of Stream which is to dilute the tokens within the time interval.

## Code Snippet

[StreamFactory.sol#L184-L213](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/StreamFactory.sol#L184-L213)

```solidity
function createStream(
  address payer,
  address recipient,
  uint256 tokenAmount,
  address tokenAddress,
  uint256 startTime,
  uint256 stopTime,
  uint8 nonce
) public returns (address stream) {
  // These input checks are here rather than in Stream because these parameters are written
  // using clone-with-immutable-args, meaning they are already set when Stream is created and can't be
  // verified there. The main benefit of this approach is significant gas savings.
  if (payer == address(0)) revert PayerIsAddressZero();
  if (recipient == address(0)) revert RecipientIsAddressZero();
  if (tokenAmount == 0) revert TokenAmountIsZero();
  if (stopTime <= startTime) revert DurationMustBePositive();
  if (tokenAmount < stopTime - startTime) revert TokenAmountLessThanDuration();

  stream = streamImplementation.cloneDeterministic(
      encodeData(payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime),
      salt(
          msg.sender, payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, nonce
      )
  );
  IStream(stream).initialize();

  emit StreamCreated(
      msg.sender, payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, stream
      );
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add validation to check if the stream is already in the past.

```diff
function createStream(
  address payer,
  address recipient,
  uint256 tokenAmount,
  address tokenAddress,
  uint256 startTime,
  uint256 stopTime,
  uint8 nonce
) public returns (address stream) {
  ...
  if (tokenAmount == 0) revert TokenAmountIsZero();
+ if (stopTime <= block.timestamp) revert DurationMustBeInPresent(); //@audit - Or validate the startTime
  if (stopTime <= startTime) revert DurationMustBePositive();
  ...
}
```
