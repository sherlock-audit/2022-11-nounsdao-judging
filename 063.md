# The rather harsh requirement of `tokenAmount` makes it inapplicable for certain tokens

## Summary

The requirements for `tokenAmount >= stopTime - startTime` will not be suitable for all tokens and therefore need to be made less applicable for certain tokens like WBTC and EURS.

## Vulnerability Detail

Requiring the `tokenAmount >= stopTime - startTime` is suitable for USDC and WETH.

However, such requirements will be a bit too harsh for other popular tokens, eg, WBTC (`decimals: 8`) and EURS (`decimals: 2`). Therefore, make the system less applicable for those tokens.

For WBTC, it must be `0.31536 WBTC` per year (worth about $5,400) to meet this requirement, and for EURS, it must be at least `315,360 EURS` per year (worth about $315,000).

## Impact

The system will be inapplicable for certain tokens with higher per wei value, eg, WBTC and EURS.

## Recommendation

Consider changing to `tokenAmount * RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER >= stopTime - startTime`.
