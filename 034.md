# Cross-chain replay attacks are possible with `createStream()`

## Summary
[StreamFactory.sol#L202](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/StreamFactory.sol#L202)

Mistakes made on one chain can be re-applied to a new chain

There is no chain.id in the createStream() function data

```solidity
stream = streamImplementation.cloneDeterministic(
            encodeData(payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime),
            salt(
                msg.sender, payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, nonce
            )
```

## Vulnerability Detail
Mistakes made on one chain can be re-applied to a new chain

There is no chain.id in the createStream() function data



## Impact
If a user does `createStream() ` using the wrong network, an attacker can replay the action on the correct chain, and steal the funds a-la the wintermute gnosis safe attack, where the attacker can create the same address that the user tried to, and steal the funds from there

## Code Snippet
[StreamFactory.sol#L202](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/StreamFactory.sol#L184-L213)

```solidity
function createStream(
        address payer,
        address recipient,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address tokenAddress,
        uint256 startTime,
        uint256 stopTime,
        uint8 nonce
    ) public returns (address stream) {
        // These input checks are here rather than in Stream because these parameters are written
        // using clone-with-immutable-args, meaning they are already set when Stream is created and can't be
        // verified there. The main benefit of this approach is significant gas savings.
        if (payer == address(0)) revert PayerIsAddressZero();
        if (recipient == address(0)) revert RecipientIsAddressZero();
        if (tokenAmount == 0) revert TokenAmountIsZero();
        if (stopTime <= startTime) revert DurationMustBePositive();
        if (tokenAmount < stopTime - startTime) revert TokenAmountLessThanDuration();

        stream = streamImplementation.cloneDeterministic(
            encodeData(payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime),
            salt(
                msg.sender, payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, nonce
            )
        );
        IStream(stream).initialize();

        emit StreamCreated(
            msg.sender, payer, recipient, tokenAmount, tokenAddress, startTime, stopTime, stream
            );
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include the chain.id in `createStream()` function


Replay attacks usually come into play when a chain undergoes a hard fork and hence we start hearing a bit more about them when such an event is on the horizon.

During the first Ethereum split, between ETH and ETH Classic, this became an issue as ETH classic did not have replay protection built in. However, the ETH community resolved this by introducing a field called ChainID which is unique to each EVM-based chain.

The ETHW community has decided to use the ChainID 10001. Thereby automatically protecting the chains against replay attacks.
